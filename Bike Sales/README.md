# Excel Bike Sales Project

In this project, I performed a comprehensive data analysis using Microsoft Excel. The main objective was to clean the dataset, create insightful visualisations through pivot tables and charts, and finally compile these elements into an interactive dashboard. The dataset analysed consists of customer demographics and their purchase behaviour regarding bike sales.

Data Cleaning
The initial step involved data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency. This included:
- Removing any duplicate entries.
- Handling missing values by either filling them with appropriate data or removing the records if necessary.
- Standardising data formats for uniformity, particularly for fields such as date, currency, and categorical variables.

Data Analysis and Visualisation
Post-cleaning, I utilised Excel's pivot tables to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. Key analyses performed included:

Income Analysis: Average income of customers segmented by gender and their purchasing decisions.

Commute Distance Analysis: Distribution of customers based on their commuting distance and its correlation with bike purchases.

Dashboard Creation
The final step was to compile these visualisations into an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of the key metrics and insights:

Income Per Purchase by Gender: Displays the comparison of average incomes between customers who purchased bikes and those who didn't, for both male and female customers.

Customer Commute Analysis: Shows the relationship between the distance customers commute and their likelihood of purchasing a bike.

Conclusion
The project provided valuable insights into the factors influencing bike purchases among different customer demographics. The interactive dashboard created serves as a powerful tool for decision-makers to understand and act upon the analysed data efficiently. This exercise also enhanced my skills in data cleaning, pivot table creation, and dashboard design in Excel.
