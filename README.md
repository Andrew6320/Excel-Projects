# IT Salary Analysis
 Overview: This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard to analyse salary trends within the IT industry. The dataset, consisting of 400 simulated employee records, includes gender, years of experience, job position, and annual salary. The data was sourced from Kaggle.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Replaced gender abbreviations ('M' and 'F') with full terms ('Male' and 'Female').
- Categorise exact experience years into defined ranges:
o 0 years: Entry-Level
o 1-2 years: Junior
o 3-4 years: Mid-Level
o 5-8 years: Senior
o 9+ years: Expert
Creating Pivot Tables:
- Insert Pivot Tables to summarise data:
o Pivot Table 1: Salary by Job Position and Experience Level
 Rows: Job Position
 Columns: Experience Level
 Values: Average Salary
o Pivot Table 2: Total Salary by Experience Level
 Rows: Experience Level
 Values: Total Salary
Generating Charts:
- Chart 1: Salary Distribution by Job Position and Experience Level
o Create a bar chart using data from Pivot Table 1.
o Label axes and add a legend to differentiate experience levels.
- Chart 2: Total Salary by Experience Level
o Create a bar chart using data from Pivot Table 2.
o Label axes and add a total salary value.
Building the Dashboard:
- Combine the charts into a single dashboard sheet.
- Add an interactive slicer for gender to filter the data and update charts dynamically.
- Arrange charts and slicers for clear and intuitive analysis.
Conclusion:
The IT Salary Analysis Dashboard is a powerful tool for visualising salary data in the IT sector. It enables detailed analysis and offers valuable insights for HR professionals, managers, and industry analysts interested in understanding compensation trends and making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
